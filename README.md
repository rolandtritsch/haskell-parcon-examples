# The examples from *the* book

These are (some) of the examples from the [Parallel and Concurrent Programming in Haskell]() book by Simon Marlow.

To make this work you need to ...

* install git and clone this repo
* install stack
* run `stack build`
* run `stack exec chapter01` (or any other of the mains in the app directory)

Note: You can also build/run this with [eta](https://eta-lang.org) (e.g. `etlas build && etlas run chapter01-exe`).
